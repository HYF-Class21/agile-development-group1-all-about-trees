# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Spent too much time on planning.
- In development strategy
  - Don't put should-have and could-have in development strategy. It's only for
    must-have.
  - Don't use `body` as title because it's not clear enough. Better to use
    `main section` or `description`.

## Continue Doing

- Have a stand-up meeting everyday.
- Reply to slack actively.

## Start Doing

- :star2: Each issue should link to a pull request.
- Add `need revision` stage to the project board.
- In backlog :
  - Clarify the features are for general user or only for a certain role.
  - The feature should be specific enough.
  - Pay attention to the text levels, every single user story should be aligned
    correctly.
  - Prioritize the features in orders.

## Lessons Learned

- We should better organize our time to finish the project in one week.
- How to plan the task on different branches and merge them to master branch
  later.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- To meet each day online and cooperate together as a team.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- We didn't manage to finish the project in time.
- We should update the status of issue on the project board accordingly.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We should better separate the tasks on Sunday when we meet in person, it's
  easier and more clear than to discuss online.

### Or remove extra steps?

- Should-have and could-have shouldn't be in development strategy.
