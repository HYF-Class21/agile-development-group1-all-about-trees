## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

      that can lead me to different pages of the website accordingly so that I
      can easily find the information I'm looking for.

  - _Given that the user want to be navigated to the specific information he is
    looking for when he clicks on the navbar then a organized list of links will
    show up._

  - [ ] As an environmental activist I want to have share buttons at the bottom
        of the page that link to different social medias so that I can share
        certain information from this page to the public.
  - _Given that the user wants to access the social media related to the site,
    when the user clicks any of the buttons at the bottom of the page then it
    gets redirected into one of the sites linked to it._

        about the content of the site.
